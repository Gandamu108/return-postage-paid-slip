## Returns contact list app 
Made by Flutter｜Smartphone and web support｜Automatic PDF generation

## Overview

This app was developed to make the paper-based **Returns Communication** process 
“quick, easy, and error-free” for anyone.

At a cleaning factory run by a family member, 
records of returns were written on paper, causing the following problems:

- Mistakes and difficulty in reading handwritten records  
- Risk of loss  
- Time-consuming storage and sharing  

This app is designed to solve those problems one by one.  
**“Paper hassle, smartphone hassle in an instant” - that is the theme of this app. **



## Main functions

- Input customer information and return details  
- Automatic writing and formatting to PDF  
- Linkage with printing function  
- Support for both smartphones and PCs (web support)

- Multilingual support (for foreign staff)  
- UI accessibility improvements (visibility, reading out loud, etc.)

This app started in a small factory.  
But we intend to further develop it as **“a simple digital contact list that can be used at any site.”
